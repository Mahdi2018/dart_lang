## 📖 What is Dart?

[Dart](https://dart.dev/) is a **client-optimized programming language** created by Google, designed for developing fast, scalable, and high-performance applications. With a focus on **UI-first development**, Dart is the backbone of **Flutter**, Google's popular cross-platform framework for building apps that run on mobile, web, desktop, and beyond. 🌐

### Key Features of Dart:
- **Cross-platform development**: Write once, run anywhere!  
- **Object-oriented and simple syntax**: Easy to learn for developers from any background.  
- **High performance**: Dart compiles to **native machine code** or **JavaScript** for faster execution.  
- **Asynchronous programming**: Built-in support for `async` and `await`.  
- **Rich libraries and tools**: A vast ecosystem for every development need.
